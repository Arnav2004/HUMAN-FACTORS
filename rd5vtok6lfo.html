In zero g muscle mass can be lost at as high as 5% a week. For bones it can be 1% a month. Long duration</div><div></div><div>    GRAVITY-the surface gravity of earth is 1g.while that on     TRAPPIST1d,    TRAPPIST1e and    TRAPPIST1f is 0.71g,    ,0.69g and 0.61g respectively.so,the gravity diffeence is of 25%.this means that human movement will decrease from 9.81 m/s to 6.96m/s.this will also result in decrease of weight of humans by 25%.so,an average adult will weigh 42kg instead of 56g.</div><div>    </div>
