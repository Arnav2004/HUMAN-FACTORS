<div><b>4.</b>Renaissance is a space settlement that will serve as a contingency plan for the planet. the settlement will take 10,000 humans into space and preserve embryos so as to ensure the survival of the human race. renaissance is the ultimate solution to the destruction of the planet in case of an emergency.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div><b>4.1.BASIC AMENITIES</b>- Water, Food , Clothes, A place to live,&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div></div><div><b>4.1.1.CONSUMABLES</b>-&nbsp; food stuff, water</div><div></div><div><b>4.2.SPACESUIT</b>- The Space suit will be made of Dyneema which is a highly durable material 10x times stronger then steel as the outermost layer. There will be a layer of spandex underneath and layer of Liquid Cooling Ventilation System which removes body heat from the wearer in environments where cooling done to the human body in an atmosphere can't&nbsp; cool the body.There will be detachable oxygen tanks in the suit.The transparent part of the space helmet is made of Polycarbonate a transparent tough , clear and light plastic.    &nbsp;It absorbs UV light and doesn’t transmit heat nearly as fast as glass. It’s chemical resistant and has twice the impact resistance of PVC, eight times that of acrylic. Polycarbonate scratches easily but it could be layered with Gorilla Glass to prevent this. The insides of the Spacesuit will have sensors to monitor the internals of the person in the suit. The spacesuit will have lithium hydroxide canisters to remove carbon dioxide.    These canisters are located either in the space suit's life support backpack or in the spacecraft, in which case they are accessed through pipes. Their will be a communication system in the helmet. Sound in the headset and any information the wearer needs will be provided by a detachable smart watch which can be attached to any part of the suit. The tanks will be made of titanium . The Smartwatches will be electroplated with Graphine</div><div></div><div>precaution: The astronaut must pre-breath pure oxygen before spacewalking.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div><b>4.2.1.EFFECTS OF ZERO G</b>- Gravity isn't only a force but also a stimulus which puts weight on the bodies muscles as well as bones and tells them to develop. In zero g muscle mass can be lost at as high as 5% a week. For bones it can be 1% a month. Long duration</div><div></div><div>    GRAVITY-the surface gravity of earth is 1g.while that on     TRAPPIST1d,    TRAPPIST1e and    TRAPPIST1f is 0.71g,    ,0.69g and 0.61g respectively.so,the gravity diffeence is of 25%.this means that human movement will decrease from 9.81 m/s to 6.96m/s.this will also result in decrease of weight of humans by 25%.so,an average adult will weigh 42kg instead of 56g.</div><div>    </div>
