<div>4.&nbsp;</div><div>BASIC AMENITIES- Water, Food , Clothes, A place to live,&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>CONSUMABLES-&nbsp; food stuff, water</div><div></div><div>SPACESUIT- The Space suit will be made of Dyneema which is a highly durable material 10x times stronger then steel as the outermost layer. There will be a layer of spandex underneath and layer of Liquid Cooling Ventilation System which removes body heat from the wearer in environments where cooling done to the human body in an atmosphere can't&nbsp; cool the body.There will be detachable oxygen tanks in the suit.The transparent part of the space helmet is made of Polycarbonate a transparent tough , clear and light plastic.    &nbsp;It absorbs UV light and doesn’t transmit heat nearly as fast as glass. It’s chemical resistant and has twice the impact resistance of PVC, eight times that of acrylic. Polycarbonate scratches easily but it could be layered with Gorilla Glass to prevent this. The insides of the Spacesuit will have sensors to monitor the internals of the person in the suit. The spacesuit will have lithium hydroxide canisters to remove carbon dioxide.    These canisters are located either in the space suit's life support backpack or in the spacecraft, in which case they are accessed through an umbilical cord. Their will be a communication system in the helmet. Sound in the headset and any information the wearer needs will be provided by a detachable smart watch which can be attached to any part of the suit. The tanks will be made of titanium . The suit will have chargeable batteries for power.1</div><div></div><div></div><div>precaution: The astronaut must pre-breath pure oxygen before spacewalking.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN IN ZERO G- Gravity isn't only a force but also a stimulus which puts weight on the bodies muscles as well as bones and tells them to develop. In zero g muscle mass can be lost at as high as 5% a week.For bones it can be 1% a month. Long duration</div><div></div><div>EMBRYO CRYOPRESERVATION-we will take 1 million embryos to space.it will be put in the compartment of the spaceship.they will first be frozen to -196<sup>o</sup>c using liquid nitrogen.it will remain in this condition for a 100 years.if the temperature rises,the emergency liquid nitrogen tanks on top of the container will start cooling the embryos. they will be taken care of by A I controlled robots.diseases caused by protozoa and algae will be prevented as they wont be able to sustain in low temperatures.bacteria will die due to the unavailability of food and infection by virus will be prevented by monthly sterilizing with hydrogen peroxide vapors.once the apocalypse has taken place,we will unfreeze the embryos by rapid water thawing in 4 seconds and transfer them to TRAPPIST 1e. from then on,they will be incubated at 37<sup>o</sup>c in industrial incubators which will be built on to the planet.the will hold 50,000 embryos at a time and 20 such will be built.the safety measures will remain the same.within,6-7 months,the embryos would have fully grown into a foetus. they will be provided nutrition using an IV tube connected to a container housing the basic nutrients required for growth.then,they will be taken to controlled nurseries,where they would be nurtured and grown.they will be taught communication skills and within 8-11 years of age,a nano chip will be implanted in their brains.intercepted by the process of    electroencephalography.this will prevent them spending time on education and open the door to finding and developing new ideas quickly.</div><div></div><div>TEMPERATURE CONTROL-</div><div>there will be auto functional vents which will also regulate the temperature of the whole planet using industrial air conditioners&nbsp; and provide the habitants a continuous habitable temperature of 22<sup>o</sup>c.this also refers to bacterial growth in masses.but they wont be able to enter humans due </div><div>to the spacesuit material.</div><div></div><div><b>FOOD VENTS</b>-there will be vents attached to every residence which will be auto functional and will also provide food to every person at regular intervals as listed in the diet chart</div><div></div><div>GRAVITY-the surface gravity of earth is 1g.while that on     TRAPPIST1d,    TRAPPIST1e and    TRAPPIST1f is 0.71g,    ,0.69g and 0.61g respectively.so,the gravity diffeence is of 25%.this means that human movement will decrease from 9.81 m/s to 6.96m/s.this will also result in decrease of weight of humans by 25%.so,an average adult will weigh 42kg instead of 56g.</div><div>   </div><div><b>NUTRITION</b></div><div>breakfast-    -spinach omelette,milk and bread without yeast    </div>
