<div>4.neo kosmo is a space settlement that will provide residents all basic amenities and luxuries,provide a home like feel in space.neo kosmo will be a contingency plan for earth.if an apocalypse strikes planet earth and the human race is eliminated,we will revive the race back on another group of&nbsp; &nbsp;planet,which consists of TRAPPIST1d,    TRAPPIST1e and    TRAPPIST1f.the possible reasons of apocalypse could be the eradication of ozone layer,nuclear war and epidemic.</div><div>BASIC AMENITIES-</div><div>CONSUMABLES-</div><div>SPACESUIT-</div><div>EMBRYO CRYOPRESERVATION-we will take 1 million embryos to space.it will be put in the compartment of the spaceship.they will first be frozen to -196<sup>o</sup>c using liquid nitrogen.it will remain in this condition for a 100 years.if the temperature rises,the emergency liquid nitrogen tanks on top of the container will start cooling the embryos. they will be taken care of by A I controlled robots.diseases caused by protozoa and algae will be prevented once the apocalypse has taken place,we will unfreeze the embryos by rapid water thawing in 4 seconds and transfer them to TRAPPIST 1e.</div><div>MAPPING-</div><div>GRAVITY-the surface gravity of earth is 1g.while that on     TRAPPIST1d,    TRAPPIST1e and    TRAPPIST1f is 0.71g,    ,0.69g and 0.61g respectively.so,the gravity diffeence is of 25%.this means that human movement will decrease from 9.81 m/s to 6.96m/s.this will also result in decrease of weight of humans by 25%.so,an average adult will weigh 42kg instead of 56g.</div><div>   </div><div>NUTRITION</div><div>breakfast-    -spinach omelette,milk and bread without yeast    </div><div></div><div>lunch-    fish curry with potato,bread without yeast and salad    </div><div></div><div>snacks-vanila cake slices with pretzels</div><div></div><div>dinner-lentils,bread without yeast and milk</div><div>    </div>
