<div>4.neo kosmo is a space settlement that will provide residents all basic amenities and luxuries,provide a home like feel in space.neo kosmo will be a contingency plan for earth.if an apocalypse strikes planet earth and the human race is eliminated,we will revive the race back on another group of&nbsp; &nbsp;planet,which consists of TRAPPIST1d,    TRAPPIST1e and    TRAPPIST1f.the possible reasons of apocalypse could be the eradication of ozone layer,nuclear war and epidemic.</div><div></div><div>BASIC AMENITIES-</div><div></div><div>CONSUMABLES-</div><div></div><div>SPACESUIT- The Space suit will be made of Dyneema which is a highly durable material 10X times stronger then steel as the outermost layer. There will me a layer of spandex underneath and layer of Liquid Cooling Ventilation System which removes body heat from the wearer in environments where cooling done to the human body in an atmosphere can't&nbsp; cool the body.There will be detachable oxygen tanks in the suit.The transparent part of the space helmet is made of Polycarbonate a transparent tough , clear and light plastic.</div><div></div><div>EMBRYO CRYOPRESERVATION-we will take 1 million embryos to space.it will be put in the compartment of the spaceship.they will first be frozen to -196<sup>o</sup>c using liquid nitrogen.it will remain in this condition for a 100 years.if the temperature rises,the emergency liquid nitrogen tanks on top of the container will start cooling the embryos. they will be taken care of by A I controlled robots.diseases caused by protozoa and algae will be prevented as they wont be able to sustain in low temperatures.bacteria will die due to the unavailability of food and infection by virus will be prevented by monthly sterilizing with hydrogen peroxide vapors.once the apocalypse has taken place,we will unfreeze the embryos by rapid water thawing in 4 seconds and transfer them to TRAPPIST 1e. from then on,they will be incubated at 37<sup>o</sup>c in industrial incubators which will be built on to the planet.the will hold 50,000 embryos at a time and 20 such will be built.the safety measures will remain the same.within,6-7 months,the embryos would have fully grown into a foetus. they will be provided nutrition using an IV tube connected to a container housing the basic nutrients required for growth.then,they will be taken to controlled nurseries,where they would be nurtured and grown.they will be taught communication skills and within 8-11 years of age,a nano chip will be implanted in their brains.intercepted by the process of    electroencephalography.this will prevent them spending time on education and open the door to finding and developing new ideas quickly.</div><div></div><div>MAPPING-</div><div>GRAVITY-the surface gravity of earth is 1g.while that on     TRAPPIST1d,    TRAPPIST1e and    TRAPPIST1f is 0.71g,    ,0.69g and 0.61g respectively.so,the gravity diffeence is of 25%.this means that human movement will decrease from 9.81 m/s to 6.96m/s.this will also result in decrease of weight of humans by 25%.so,an average adult will weigh 42kg instead of 56g.</div><div>   </div><div>NUTRITION</div><div>breakfast-    -spinach omelette,milk and bread without yeast    </div>
