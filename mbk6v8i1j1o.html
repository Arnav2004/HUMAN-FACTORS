There will be a layer of spandex underneath and layer of Liquid Cooling Ventilation System which removes body heat from the wearer in environments where cooling done to the human body in an atmosphere can't&nbsp; cool the body.There will be detachable oxygen tanks in the suit.The visor of the space helmet is made of Polycarbonate, a transparent, tough, and light plastic.    &nbsp;It absorbs UV light and doesnâ€™t transmit heat nearly as fast as glass. It is chemical resistant and has twice the impact resistance of PVC, eight times that of acrylic. Polycarbonate scratches easily but it could be layered with Gorilla Glass to prevent this. The insides of the Spacesuit will have sensors to monitor the internals of the person in the suit. The spacesuit will have lithium hydroxide canisters to remove carbon dioxide.    These canisters are located either in the space suit's life support backpack or in the spacecraft, in which case they are accessed through pipes. There will be a communication system in the helmet. Sound in the headset and any information the wearer needs will be provided by a detachable smart watch which can be attached to any part of the suit.
