<div><b>4.3.EMBRYO CRYOPRESERVATION</b></div><div>Precisely 1 million embryos will be taken to space It will be put in the compartment of the spaceship.they will first be frozen to -196<sup>o</sup>c using liquid nitrogen.it will remain in this condition for a 100 years.if the temperature rises,the emergency liquid nitrogen tanks on top of the container will start cooling the embryos. they will be taken care of by A I controlled robots.diseases caused by protozoa and algae will be prevented as they wont be able to sustain in low temperatures.bacteria will die due to the unavailability of food and infection by virus will be prevented by monthly sterilizing with hydrogen peroxide vapors.once the apocalypse has taken place,we will unfreeze the embryos by rapid water thawing in 4 seconds and transfer them to TRAPPIST 1e.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>From then on,they will be incubated at 37<sup>o</sup>C in industrial incubators which will be built on to the planet.the will hold 50,000 embryos at a time and 20 such will be built.the safety measures will remain the same.within,6-7 months,the embryos would have fully grown into a foetus. they will be provided nutrition using an IV tube connected to a container housing the basic nutrients required for growth.then,they will be taken to controlled nurseries,where they would be nurtured and grown.they will be taught communication skills and within 8-11 years of age,a nano chip will be implanted in their brains.intercepted by the process of    electroencephalography. this will prevent them spending time on education and open the door to finding and developing new ideas quickly.</div><div></div><div><b>4.4.RESIDENTIAL SYSTEM</b></div><div>The Renaissance is an advanced contingency plan and will provide housing to its selected population. The residential system occupies a torus of the main structure and includes all facilities to ensure comfort of the occupants. it includes three types of housing plans, dormitories, flats and condominiums. all systems are closely integrated with the residential system so that occupants do not feel a need. The residential system strives to be a perfect simulation of the residences on the planet and includes every basic amenity that the resident requires.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div><b>4.4.1.TEMPERATURE CONTROL</b>-</div><div>there will be auto functional vents which will also regulate the temperature of the whole planet using industrial air conditioners&nbsp; and provide the habitants a continuous habitable temperature of 22<sup>o</sup>c.this also refers to bacterial growth in masses.but they wont be able to enter humans due </div><div>to the spacesuit material and frequent sanitisation.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div><b>4.4.2.FOOD VENTS</b></div><div>There will be dumbwaiter attached to every residence which will be auto and will also provide food to every person at regular intervals as listed in the diet chart.</div><div>they will provide food only in the dormitories,</div><div></div><div><b>4.4.3.NUTRITION</b></div><div>breakfast-    -spinach omelette,milk and bread without yeast    </div>
